## ðŸ§ª Cross platform and user testing

### Local manual testing

Make sure you have the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed, which enables devices on the same network to connect to the app.

_Warning: This may not work on public networks (e.g. school and work)!_

1. Open a browser on a device to connect and enter the following address (make sure it's connected to the same network as the host):

   ```console
   http://HOST.IP.ADDRESS:PORT/
   ```

   For example:

   ```console
   http://192.168.0.36:3000/
   ```

### Deployment and remote testing

As of 15.09.2020, this is not implemented. No preference? Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
